<!--This is the base script application template it includes a css file and js file.
 you can add what you want to any of these files but they will be overwritten if you re add the scripting package
 it's better to make a copy of these files with the same base name i.e. see the wef-page files.
 You can add as many templates as you like by placing them in the wizard_templates folder
 the name that is displayed for the template is the name of the html file -->
